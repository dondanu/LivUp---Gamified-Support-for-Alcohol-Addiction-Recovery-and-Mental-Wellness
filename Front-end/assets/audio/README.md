# Music Files for Music Therapy Challenge

## How to Add Music Files

1. **Download peaceful/calming music files** (MP3 format recommended)
   - You can use royalty-free music from:
     - https://freemusicarchive.org/
     - https://pixabay.com/music/
     - https://www.bensound.com/
   
2. **Place music files here:**
   - For Android: `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`
   - For iOS: Add to Xcode project in `ios/TempProject/`

3. **Recommended files:**
   - `peaceful_music.mp3` - Main peaceful music track
   - `calming_sounds.mp3` - Alternative calming track
   - `meditation_music.mp3` - Meditation background music

4. **File naming:**
   - Use lowercase with underscores
   - Example: `peaceful_music.mp3`
   - No spaces or special characters

## For Quick Testing

You can also use online music URLs temporarily, but local files work better and don't require internet.
